Recent advances in formal verification are being used to secure everything from unmanned drones to the internet. At the same time, the usable security research community has made huge progress in improving the usability of security products and end-users comprehension of security issues. However, there have been no human-centered studies focused on the impact of formal verification on the use and adoption of formally verified software products. We propose a research agenda to fill this gap and to contribute with the first collection of studies on people’s mental models on formal verification and associated security and privacy guarantees and threats.

Security experts advocate the usage of password managers. These tools can improve account security by enabling the utilization of unique and robust passwords, simultaneously improving the usability and convenience of text password authentication. However, these tools are not prepared to deal with overly restrictive password composition policies, which many websites employ. These policies pose challenges to password managers and may impact their usage: users become frustrated when generated passwords do not comply with such policies. We aim to solve this problem by 1) combining a language capable of describing password rules and a widely used password manager --- Bitwarden ---, and 2) expanding said language to express policies suggested by experts, which combine security and usability. We generated compliant passwords for every policy tested with our prototype, and Bitwarden accepted our solution to incorporate in their final product. These results are encouraging and suggest that password managers benefit from this ability to interpret password policies, which is a further step to increase the adoption of password managers.","tags":[],"title":"SmartPasswords: Increasing Password Managers' Usability by Generating Compliant Passwords","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rui Lima","João F.

Despite much research, there is little definitive, scientific guidance on how these mechanisms should be combined and configured to best effect. Through two online experiments, we evaluated combinations of minimum-length and character-class requirements, blocklists, and a minimum-strength requirement that requires passwords to exceed a strength threshold according to neural-network-driven password-strength estimates.\nOur results lead to concrete recommendations for policy configurations that produce a good balance of security and usability. In particular, for high-value user accounts we recommend policies that combine minimum-strength and minimum-length requirements. While we offer recommendations for organizations required to use blocklists, using blocklists does not provide further gains. Interestingly, we also find that against expert attackers, character-class requirements, traditionally associated with producing stronger passwords, in practice may provide very little improvement and may even reduce effective security.","tags":[],"title":"Practical recommendations for stronger, more usable passwords combining minimum-strength, minimum-length, and blocklist requirements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saul Johnson","João F.

In practice, however, this choice is not usually rigorous or justifiable, with a tendency for system administrators to choose password composition policies based on intuition alone. In this work, we propose a methodology that draws on password probability distributions constructed from large sets of real-world password data which have been filtered according to various password composition policies. Password probabilities are then redistributed to simulate different user password reselection behaviours in order to automatically determine the password composition policy that will induce the distribution of user-chosen passwords with the greatest uniformity, a metric which we show to be a useful proxy to measure the overall resistance to password guessing attacks. Further, we show that by fitting power-law equations to the password probability distributions we generate, we can justify our choice of password composition policy without any direct access to user password data. Finally, we present Skeptic, a software toolkit that implements this methodology, including a DSL to enable system administrators with no background in password security to compare and rank password composition policies. Drawing on 205,176,321 passwords across 3 datasets, we lend validity to our approach by demonstrating that the results we obtain align closely with findings from a previous empirical study into password composition policy effectiveness.","tags":[],"title":"Skeptic: Automatic, Justified and Privacy-Preserving Password Composition Policy Selection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Pereira","João F.

However, research indicates that only a small fraction of users use password managers with password generators. Past studies have explored factors in the adoption of password managers using surveys and online store reviews. Here we describe a semi-structured interview study with 30 participants that allows us to provide a more comprehensive picture of the mindsets underlying adoption and effective use of password managers and password-generation features. Our participants include users who use no password-specific tools at all, those who use password managers built into browsers or operating systems, and those who use separately installed password managers. Furthermore, past field data has indicated that users of built-in, browser-based password managers more often use weak and reused passwords than users of separate password managers that have password generation available by default. Our interviews suggest that users of built-in password managers may be driven more by convenience, while users of separately installed tools appear more driven by security. We advocate tailored designs for these two mentalities and provide actionable suggestions to induce effective password manager usage.","tags":[],"title":"Why people (don’t) use password managers effectively","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"With the explosive growth of our data economy, the quantity of personal data and other valuable assets available online has increased massively. At the same time, despite years of searching for viable alternatives, text passwords remain the dominant access control mechanism to access that data and those assets.\nUsers’ attitudes towards passwords can thus put at risk the security of our data economy. For example, users have shown that they tend to choose weak passwords that are easy to guess by password cracking software. Moreover, many users reuse the same password across different systems, which can have serious consequences for users and organizations affected by data breaches. In the last few years, breaches at organizations like Yahoo!, Dropbox, Lastpass, LinkedIn, and eBay have exposed over a billion user passwords to attackers.\nTo address this problem, security experts recommend the use of password managers (PMs) that combine secure password storage and retrieval with random password generation. These tools can improve account security by enabling the use of strong and unique passwords, simultaneously improving the usability and convenience of text password authentication. However, despite its critical importance, the adoption of PMs is still low. Reasons for this include distrust on the storage mechanisms and on the quality of generated passwords.\nPassCert’s short-term vision is to build an open-source, proof-of-concept PM that through the use of formal verification, is guaranteed to satisfy properties on data storage and password generation. The goal is to help non-expert users to use stronger passwords without sacrificing convenience, whilst conveying the formal guarantees in an effective way. We aim to determine whether formal verification can increase users’ confidence in PMs and thus increase their adoption. The proof-of-concept PM will result from a close collaboration between researchers from INESC-ID Lisboa, INESC TEC, and The Carnegie Mellon CyLab Security and Privacy Institute.\nContacts Principal Investigator in Portugal: João F.
